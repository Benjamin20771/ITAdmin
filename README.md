Internship notes

A VM (Virtual Machine) is a fully fledged "virtual computer" that your computer runs inside of itself. It feeds off the host computers resources in return acting as a fully usable computer (without any physical parts).

IT team members should be at the very least familiar with the operating systems that are commonly used by the Leahy Center. Google is very much your friend here, and feel free to ask me or your coworkers for assistance.

The OS's you should know are


Windows 10, Windows 11 (Used by the majority of businesses today)
MacOS (Common among artists & creative majors, & it is always great be familiar with MacOS) It is much harder to virtualize MacOS on systems other than MacOS since it is very closed source, but it is possible.

Linux (Very important! Linux is used for critical services for many organizations! It runs websites, keeps systems secure, does many many things!)
